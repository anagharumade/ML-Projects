# ML-Projects
This repository contains my various Machine Learning Projects

## Optimizing K-Means Clustering
In this project, we try to find Better Initial Centroids for K-Means Clustering so that the number of iterations required to converge on the final Centroids are lesser hence the process is faster

The code for this project can be found here: [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/anagharumade/K-means-Clustering/blob/7103477b7cfa181cd03c04a5850ce87fb73f37b3/3D%20Road%20Network.ipynb)

## TensorFlow
In this sub repository TensorFlow workflow is explored.

A basic workflow implementation of TensorFlow can be found here: [Basic TensorFlow Workflow Implementation](https://github.com/anagharumade/ML-Projects/blob/master/TensorFlow/Basic%20Workflow%20Implementation.ipynb). This program takes two numbers as input and provides their addition as output. The TensorFlow workflow is incorporated in this program.

In the Project **'Neural Networks with TensorFlow'** the machine is trained to Identify and correctly predict hand-written numbers using Artificial Neural Networks with the TensorFlow workflow. The code for the same can be found here: [Neural Networks with TensorFlow](https://github.com/anagharumade/ML-Projects/blob/master/TensorFlow/Neural%20Networks%20with%20TensorFlow.ipynb)

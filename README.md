## Optimizing K-Means Clustering
The code for this project can be found here: [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/anagharumade/K-means-Clustering/blob/7103477b7cfa181cd03c04a5850ce87fb73f37b3/3D%20Road%20Network.ipynb)

In this project, we try to find Better Initial Centroids for K-Means Clustering so that the number of iterations required to converge on the final Centroids are lesser hence the process is faster
